\section{Introduction (6)}\label{introduction-6}

As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and climate change
elevates the risk of zoonotic spillover events, the public becomes ever
more susceptible to global-scale outbreaks.\footnote{\url{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-021-00639-z}}
In this context, traditional disease modeling techniques, while
effective for well-documented diseases, may not be as applicable for
emerging diseases with low case numbers and less understood
epidemiological parameters. Critically, public attention plays a pivotal
role in disease detection and response.

The advent of digital tools allows for the real-time tracking of this
attention, offering a valuable complement to established disease
surveillance methods. This is where public attention can serve as an
innovative proxy for tracking disease spread. In this regard, the
2022-2023 multi-country mpox outbreak presents a recent case study,
allowing us to examine the efficacy of real-time data in monitoring a
relatively novel disease. By thoroughly exploring these non-traditional
methods, we can more fully understand their advantages and limitations,
thus providing crucial insights for decision-makers. This research not
only enhances our understanding of digital epidemiology but also
contributes to shaping more effective and timely responses to future
infectious disease outbreaks.

This project\footnote{Project GitHub:
  \url{https://github.com/smkerr/Thesis_WorkInProgress}} explores the
potential for Wikipedia data to be utilized as an alternative metric for
gauging public attention towards public health emergencies, specifically
by focusing on the 2022-2023 multi-country mpox outbreak. The primary
goal is to assess whether Wikipedia, with its vast user base and
granular data, can effectively serve as a proxy for measuring public
attention and information-seeking behavior in the context of global
health crises. This work is motivated by the limitations of existing
disease modeling techniques for emerging diseases, which may lack
sufficient historical data for accurate forecasting. Public attention,
as measured by digital resources like Wikipedia, could provide early
indicators of disease outbreaks, thus aiding in more timely and
effective public health interventions.

Data on the number of confirmed mpox cases is obtained from the World
Health Organization (WHO), while page view statistics for Wikipedia
articles related to mpox are sourced directly from Wikipedia. The
analysis is restricted to the 10 countries most affected by the
outbreak, using time series analysis and lag-correlation methods to
examine the relationship between Wikipedia page views and mpox case
numbers. The study aims to identify patterns and correlations that could
support the use of Wikipedia data as a predictive tool for public health
surveillance.

This work contributes to the broader academic discourse by exploring the
potential of open-source data for enhancing disease surveillance and
response strategies. It seeks to validate the efficacy of Wikipedia, as
a non-traditional data source, in providing actionable insights to
policymakers during public health emergencies. In doing so, this work
addresses gaps in the literature regarding the effectiveness of digital
tools in enhancing disease surveillance.

\section{Literature Review (5)}\label{literature-review-5}

Several key academic papers lay the groundwork for this approach. In
\href{https://doi.org/10.2196/26331}{``Assessing Public Interest Based
on Wikipedia's Most Visited Medical Articles During the SARS-CoV-2
Outbreak: Search Trends Analysis''} by Chrzanowski et al.~(2021), the
authors investigates how public interest in medical topics changed
during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reflected by Wikipedia pageviews. The
study conducted a retrospective analysis of access to medical articles
across nine language versions of Wikipedia and correlated these patterns
with global and regional COVID-19 deaths, comparing observed data to a
forecast model trained on data from 2015-2019. This involved collecting
daily page view statistics for 37,880 articles curated by the English
Wikipedia Medicine Project from 1 July 2015 to 13 September 2020. The
authors sourced page view statistics using ToolForge, a page view
analytics tool) and sourced COVID-19 death statistics from Our World in
Data. It found a correlation between the pandemic's severity and
pageviews for COVID-19--related Wikipedia articles, concluding that
changes in article popularity could serve as a method for
epidemiological surveillance by reflecting public attention during
disease outbreaks. Furthermore, it demonstrates the potential for using
Wikipedia data for epidemiological surveillance and understanding public
information-seeking behavior during disease outbreaks. While the paper
focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic, similar methodologies can be applied
to provide insights into public attention and information-seeking
behavior during the Mpox outbreak.

\href{https://doi.org/10.1002\%2Fjmv.28382}{``Association between public
attention and monkeypox epidemic: A global lag-correlation analysis''}
by Yan et al.~(2023) investigates the association between public
attention, as measured by Google Trends Index (GTI), and the global mpox
oubtreak. The authors use Google Trends data for information on internet
search activity related to mpox as well as data on daily confirmed mpox
cases from Our World in Data. It tests time-lag correlations between GTI
and daily confirmed mpox cases across the 20 countries with the highest
case numbers as of 20 September 2022 using the Spearman correlation
coefficients, over a range of -36 to +36 days. Spearman correlation
coefficients from these 20 countries were pooled to provide a combined
correlation coefficient for each lag. To test whether the time series
was stationary, an Augment Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is applied. The
study finds a strong positive correlation, particularly noticeable 13
days after a peak in public attention. The study also conducted
meta-analyses and utilized vector autoregression (VAR) models to analyze
the temporal relationship between GTI and daily confirmed mpox cases,
and a Granger-causality test was employed to evaluate whether the GTI
trend could predict daily confirmed mpox cases. The findings suggest
that GTI could be a useful tool for early monitoring and prediction of
mpox cases, highlighting the significance of digital epidemiology in
infectious disease surveillance. The study emphasizes the potential of
internet data like GTI in providing early warning signs for health
outbreaks and aiding in rapid response strategies. While the study
utilizes GTI data to public attention towards the mpox outbreak, however
similar methods can be applied to Wikipedia pageviews data to test
whether the same conclusions can be drawn using Wikipedia as a data
source.

In \href{https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20043395}{``Trends in Online
Search Activity and the Correlation with Daily New Cases of Monkeypox
among 102 Countries or Territories''} by Du et al.~(2023), the authors
investigate the relationship between online search activity related to
mpox and the actual daily new cases of mpox across 102 countries or
territories. The study aims to understand how internet search trends can
reflect public awareness towards mpox, potentially serving as an early
indicator for outbreaks. Data on daily mpox cases from 1 May 2022 to 9
October 2022 was sourced from Our World in Data, while online search
activity data related to mpox was sourced from Google Trends using the
keyword ``monkeypox''.\footnote{Note that this study was conducted prior
  to WHO's recommendation that monkeypox instead be referred to as
  ``mpox'' on 28 November 2022:
  \url{https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2022-who-recommends-new-name-for-monkeypox-disease}}
Online search activity was expressed as relative normalized search
volume numbers (RNSNs) ranging from 0 to 100 to reflect how many
searches are performed for a keyword relative to the total number of
searches on the internet over time where a value of 100 represents the
time point at which the search term has reached its peak in popularity.
Demographic data including total population, population density, average
years of schooling, socioeconomic status, and public tourism were
sourced from the United Nations and World Bank. Data on health status
including HIV prevalence, sanitation levels, and health workforce
densities were obtained from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study.
The authors use a segmented time-series analysis to estimate the impact
of the PHEIC declaration on online search activity, adjusting for daily
new cases across 194 countries or territories. Furthermore, the study
tests time-lag correlations between online search activity and daily new
cases, specifically considering lags of -21, -14, -7, 0, +7, +14, and
+21 days. Next, a general linear regression model (GLM) is used to
explore influencing factors on the relationship between online search
activity and daily new cases. The authors find a significant correlation
between online search activity and daily mpox cases, with online
searches often preceding reporting of new cases. This study highlights
the value of integrating internet search data into public health
surveillance for emerging infectious diseases. Similar to the paper by
Yan et al., this study utilizes Google Trends data, however similar
methodologies could be applied towards Wikipedia pageviews data.

Beyond these studies, several other academic papers have contributed
analysis to various aspects of the relationship between online
information-seeking behavior and public health.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160460}{García-Gavilanes et
  al.~(2016)} use Wikipedia page view and page edit statistics to
  investigate public attention towards airline crashes.
\item
  In their analysis of page views for COVID-19-related Wikipedia pages,
  \href{https://doi.org/10.2196/21597}{Gozzi et al.~(2020)} find that
  page views were mainly driven by media coverage, declined rapidly,
  even while COVID-19 incidence remained high, raising questions about
  the impacts of attention saturation in disease outbreak settings.
\item
  \href{https://doi.org/10.3390/info14010005}{Bhagavathula and
  Raubenheimer (2023)} conducted a joinpoint regression analysis to
  measure hourly percentage changes (HPC) in search volume in the hours
  immediately preceding and following WHO's determination to assign
  PHEIC status to mpox, finding an overall increase in
  information-seeking behavior, although results varied by country. This
  study revealed a 103\% increase in public interest in top five
  Mpox-affected countries immediately following the WHO PHEIC
  announcement. However, search interest waned after the announcement,
  so that search interest appeared to reflect media attention more than
  disease spread.
\item
  \href{https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.755530}{Gong et al.~(2022)}
  use the Baidu Index (BDI) and Sina Macro Index (SMI) to investigate
  the association between public attention towards the COVID-19 pandemic
  and new cases using Spearman correlation.
\item
  \href{https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094560}{Abbas et al.~(2021)}
  analyze associations between Google Search Trends for symptoms of
  COVID-19 and confirmed cases and deaths within the United States,
  demonstrating abilitiy to predict cases up to three weeks prior.
\item
  \href{https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004239}{Hickmann et
  al.~(2015)} demonstrate that it is possible to use Wikipedia page view
  statistics and CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) reports to create a
  weekly forecast for seasonal influenza, finding that that Wikipedia
  article access are highly correlated with historical ILI records,
  allowing for highly accurate disease forecasts several weeks before
  case data is available.
\end{itemize}

Given the existing literature, this thesis aims to fill the research gap
by investigating whether Wikipedia can be predictive of mpox cases
during the 2022-2023 multi-country outbreak. While previous studies have
evaluated Wikipedia data for COVID-19 and others have utilized Google
Trends data for mpox, this thesis represents the first attempt, as far
as I am aware, to explore the relationship between Wikipedia page view
statistics and mpox cases.

\section{Theory / Research Questions and Hypotheses
(1)}\label{theory-research-questions-and-hypotheses-1}

To what extent can Wikipedia data be effectively utilized as an
alternative method for measuring public attention and
information-seeking behavior during the 2022-2023 multi-country mpox
outbreak?

This research question engages the following current and relevant
conversations within the literature:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Open Source Data for Public Health Surveillance}: Examining the
  utility and limitations of using public data sources like Wikipedia to
  monitor and assess public health events, contributing to ongoing
  discussions about their reliability and relevance.
\item
  \emph{Information Dissemination and Public Awareness}: Investigating
  the extent to which public awareness of outbreaks is shaped by the
  impact (number of cases and/or deaths), connecting with debates about
  information ecosystems and their impact on public health
  communication.
\item
  \emph{Policy Implications}: Discussing the potential policy
  recommendations and interventions that can arise from a better
  understanding of public attention and information-seeking behavior
  during outbreaks on digital platforms.
\end{itemize}

My thesis also contains several sub-questions to be investigated in
support of the main research question:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Which medical articles saw traffic volume increase significantly after
  the start of the mpox outbreak?
\item
  To what extent do the number of mpox cases correlate with the traffic
  volume of mpox-related Wikipedia articles?
\item
  How effective is Wikipedia analytics data compared to other data
  sources (e.g., Google Trends) when it comes to gauging public
  attention towards the mpox outbreak?
\end{itemize}

\section{Data and Methods (2)}\label{data-and-methods-2}

\subsection{Data sources}\label{data-sources}

To answer my research question, I will rely on two main data sources.
First, country-level data on the weekly number of mpox cases is sourced
from WHO.\footnote{\url{https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/}}
Second, Wikipedia analytics data on daily page view volume by article is
sourced directly from Wikipedia.\footnote{\url{https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_Engineering/Systems/AQS}}

My topic focuses on assessing public attention towards the 2022-2023
multi-country mpox outbreak using Wikipedia data. As such, this analysis
relies on two main data sources. First, country-level data on the weekly
number of mpox cases is sourced from the World Health Organization
(WHO). Second, Wikipedia analytics data on page view volume is sourced
directly from Wikipedia.

\subsubsection{Mpox case data}\label{mpox-case-data}

Daily aggregated numbers of mpox cases by country correspond with the
date on which cases were reported to public health authorities. One
advantage of this dataset is that it is considered to be largely
complete since it comprises every confirmed and probable case reported
to the national public health authorities.\footnote{For more information
  on what constitutes a confirmed or probable case, please refer to
  WHO's mpox case definitions:
  \url{https://www.who.int/emergencies/outbreak-toolkit/disease-outbreak-toolboxes/mpox-outbreak-toolbox}}
While this still leaves room for cases to go underreported in instances
where an individual does not seek medical attention (e.g., for fear of
stygmatization) or for asymptomatic cases, it still represents the most
comprehensive view of the outbreak's scale. Aggregated data is available
for all reported cases as of 31 December 2023.

The top 10 countries by number of confirmed cases are the United States
of America (31,246), Brazil (10,967), Spain (7,752), France (4,171),
Colombia (4,090), Mexico (4,078), the United Kingdom (3,875), Peru
(3,812), Germany (3,800), and China\footnote{Cases shown include those
  reported in mainland China (1,611), Taiwan (333), Hong Kong (80), and
  Macao (1).} (2,025).

As of 31 December 2023, mpox cases have been reported by 117 WHO Member
States across all six WHO regions. The dataset contains cases reported
between 7 January 2022 to 31 December 2023.

For this analysis, I will only consider confirmed cases. However, I do
not expect this decision to greatly impact the results considering that
probable cases only make up 0.7\% of overall cases (652/93,682) and only
eight countries report any probable cases. While Puerto Rico reports the
highest proportion of probable cases at 42\% of total cases (150/361),
probable cases make up less than 5\% of the remaining countries' total
cases.

While WHO collects aggregated data on a daily basis, nearly all
countries' public health authorities report cases at a weekly frequency.
As a result, it is more useful to aggregate cases by epidemic week. The
epidemic curve below depicts the aggregated weekly number of cases by
week reported.

While the global trend appears to have been quite coherent with the
number of weekly cases peaking in July 2022, this disguises the fact
that the trends in cases looked quite distinct at the WHO region-level.

Here we observe that there is substantial variation between the six WHO
regions, with the Eastern Mediterranean Region, European Region, and
Region of the Americas following a similar trend with cases peaking in
summer/fall 2022, while cases in the South-East Asia Region and Western
Pacific Region peak in summer/fall 2023. In contrast, cases reported by
the African Region appear to be more uniformly distributed, reflecting
the fact that mpox is endemic to certain areas of western and central
Africa.

In addition to aggregated case data, WHO also collects line list data
where each row corresponds with an individual case and contains
information on demographics, clinical presentation, epidemiological
exposure factors, and laboratory testing.\footnote{\url{https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/monkeypox-minimum-dataset-case-reporting-form-(crf)}}
Due to privacy concerns, line list data is stripped of all personally
identifiable information and aggregated by country and date before being
made available by WHO.\footnote{\url{https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/}}
In contrast to aggregated case data, the \texttt{date} variable of the
detailed case dataset corresponds with either the date of symptom onset,
the date of diagnosis (if date of symptom onset is not available), or
the date of reporting (if date of symptom onset and date of diagnosis
are not available).\footnote{\url{https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/}}
This difference in how cases are assigned to a date grants us a much
more granular view of countries' epidemic curves, as shown below. Dates
are aggregated at the weekly level to further protect individual cases'
privacy.

A significant disadvantage of this detailed dataset is that it only
contains information 63\% for all reported mpox cases (58,883/93,030).
This is driven almost entirely by the fact that WHO no longer includes
cases from the United States in this dataset, despite the fact that the
United States represents 34\% of global cases (31,246/93,030). That
said, this data can still be useful for analysis of other countries. As
such, detailed dataset can complement the aggregated data presented
above.

While WHO collects line list data on a daily basis, this data is
aggregated by epidemic week to safeguard the privacy of individual
cases. The epidemic curve below depicts the weekly number of cases.
Compared to the epidemic curves produced using aggregated data, the
detailed data allows us to plot much smoother curves which seem to
adhere more closely to the trend we might expect of an infectious
disease outbreak.

Again, while the global trend appears to have been quite coherent with
the number of weekly cases peaking in July 2022, the trends vary at the
WHO region-level.

\subsubsection{Wikipedia data}\label{wikipedia-data}

The Wikimedia Foundation makes it straightforward to access various
analytics data related to its projects, including Wikipedia, by
providing the
\href{https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_Engineering/Systems/AQS}{Wikimedia
Analytics Query Service (AQS)}
\href{https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/}{REST API}. AQS offers a range
of analytics data, such as page view statistics, editor activity levels,
and other traffic data from as far back as 1 August 2015. The REST API
facilitates the retrieval of analytics data from Wikipedia in a
structured way. Given that Wikipedia data is abundant, publicly
accessible, and commonly used, many resources exist to easily access
this data.\footnote{Mikhail Popov, Data Science Manager in Product
  Analytics at the Wikimedia Foundation, has published a list of R
  packages related to or affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation here:
  \url{https://people.wikimedia.org/~bearloga/notes/r-pkgs.html}}
\{\href{https://wikimedia.github.io/waxer/}{waxer}\} is one such package
which serves as a Wikimedia API wrapper that facilitates querying for
traffic (pageviews, unique devices), user (e.g.~active editors), and
content-based metrics (e.g.~edits counts, pages counts) from Wikimedia
Analytics Query Service with R.

Since this project is concerned with assessing public attention,
Wikipedia page view statistics will serve as our primary measure for
online information-seeking behavior. We query page view statistics from
the AQS REST API using the following specifications:

We start exploring the dataset by examining the absolute and relative
frequency of different values within the \texttt{project} and
\texttt{page\_name} variables. As expected, all page views are for the
English Wikipedia project. Notably, the ``Mpox'' article has a
substantially higher traffic volume than the ``Monkeypox virus'' article
(71\% vs.~29\%).

Next, we explore the missingness of each of variable in the
\texttt{pageviews} dataset. We find that \texttt{redirect\_name} is the
only column missing values. For the specified Wikipedia project and
articles, 27\% of page views were redirected from other search terms.

Seeing as a substantial number of page views are driven by redirects, it
is important to understand whether it is valid to include these
redirects in our analysis. If search terms appear related to mpox or the
monkeypox virus, then it is safe to assume that this represents online
information-seeking behavior towards our topic. Our table shows that all
search appear to directly relate to mpox or the monkeypox virus, so we
conclude that is valid to include redirects in this analysis. This will
be reevaluated and handled as more projects and articles are added to
the analysis.

Considering that mpox case data is available at a weekly level of
granularity, we aggregate page view data by week and plot the results
below. We observer two large spikes, with the first centered on May 2022
when non-endemic countries began reporting mpox cases\footnote{\url{https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/monkeypox-oubreak-2022}}
and the second centered on late July 2022 when WHO declared mpox to be a
Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\footnote{\url{https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/23-07-2022-who-director-general-declares-the-ongoing-monkeypox-outbreak-a-public-health-event-of-international-concern}}
Other smaller peaks can be observed, although the general trend
indicates that public attention decreases over time.

Another element of this project involves developing a baseline for what
online information-seeking behavior may have looked like in the absence
of the mpox outbreak, as measured by Wikipedia article access. For this,
we will use overall project views for the respective Wikipedia projects
to detect seasonality and long-term trends in Wikipedia search trends.
To illustrate what this looks, we examine the Wikipedia projects
corresponding with the most common languages in the top 10 countries by
number of mpox cases.

The plot below shows that English Wikipedia predominates overall
Wikipedia traffic, with weekly traffic levels for the other language
projects clustered together well below.

While this Data Report showcases the underlying data structure of
Wikipedia page view statistics using as ``Mpox'' and ``Monkeypox virus''
articles as mere examples, there are many other articles related to mpox
and its symptoms\footnote{\url{https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox}}
that may also contribute to this analysis. Supplemental article titles
are listed below. Since article titles have been recorded in English,
the next step would be to cross-reference them with their corresponding
titles for other Wikipedia projects.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

While mpox case data is available for 117 WHO Member States and
Wikipedia page view statistics exist for nearly 300 languages, I will
limit the scope of this analysis to the 10 countries with the most
cumulative cases, including the United States of America (31,246),
Brazil (10,967), Spain (7,752), France (4,171), Colombia (4,090), Mexico
(4,078), the United Kingdom (3,875), Peru (3,812), Germany (3,800), and
China\footnote{Cases shown include those reported in mainland China
  (1,611), Taiwan (333), Hong Kong (80), and Macao (1).} (2,025).
Accordingly, I will limit the analysis to the Wikipedia projects for the
languages that prominently feature in these countries, including English
(the United States of America and the United Kingdom), Portuguese
(Brazil), Spanish (Spain, Mexico, and Peru), French (France), German
(Germany), Chinese (China). I will examine the time period from 1
January 2022 to 31 December 2023.

My proposed methodology takes inspiration from th work of
\href{https://doi.org/10.1002\%2Fjmv.28382}{Yan et al.} and
\href{https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20043395}{Du et al.} I will conduct
an observational study to assess the lag-correlation between public
attention and mpox cases for the 10 countries with the most cumulative
cases.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Define collection of mpox-related Wikipedia articles

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Identify articles directly related to mpox, including historical
    information, symptoms, treatment, and prevention.
  \item
    Identify articles with a low degree of separation within network of
    Wikipedia articles.
  \item
    Analyze Wikipedia page view statistics to identify medical articles
    that experienced significant increases in traffic coinciding with
    the timeline of the 2022-2023 mpox outbreak.\footnote{An assessment
      would need to be made to determine that the increase in traffic
      volume of certain medical articles following the start of the
      outbreak is not spurious but substantial.}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Data preparation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Collect daily mpox case numbers from WHO.
  \item
    Extract daily traffic volume data for the defined collection of
    Wikipedia articles using Wikipedia's API with the \{waxer\} package
    using R.
  \item
    De-noise data by aggregating both mpox cases and Wikipedia page view
    statistics to the weekly level.
  \item
    Standardize Wikipedia traffic volumes to be expressed as a
    percentage of total traffic volume for a given Wikipedia language
    version.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Statistical analysis

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Perform Spearman correlation tests to examine the time-lag
    relationship between Wikipedia traffic volumes and mpox case
    numbers. The range of -21 to +21 days will allow analysis of lead
    and lag effects.
  \item
    Use non-parametric methods, considering the non-normal distribution
    of the data.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Implement the ADF test to check for stationarity in both the
    Wikipedia traffic and mpox case series. Non-stationary data can lead
    to spurious results in subsequent analyses.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Vector autoregression (VAR) model

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Develop a VAR model to understand the dynamic relationship between
    the two time series. This model will help in capturing the temporal
    interdependencies and feedback mechanisms between Wikipedia traffic
    and mpox cases.
  \item
    Determine the optimal lag length for the VAR model based on
    information criteria like AIC or BIC.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Granger causality test

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Apply the Granger causality test within the VAR framework to assess
    whether Wikipedia traffic volumes can be considered a predictor of
    mpox case trajectories.
  \item
    This test will help determine if changes in Wikipedia page views
    precede changes in mpox cases, indicating a predictive relationship.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Validation and robustness checks

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Conduct sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the findings
    against different model specifications and subsets of data.
  \item
    Validate the results through comparison with other studies or
    datasets.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Interpretation and implications

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Interpret the results, while considering the limitations of
    observational data and the potential for confounding factors.
  \item
    Discuss the implications for public health surveillance during
    health emergencies.
  \end{itemize}
