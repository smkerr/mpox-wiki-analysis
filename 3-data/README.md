# Data Sources

* **Our World in Data (OWID)**: Mpox cases by country and report date were downloaded from OWID's [`monkeypox` repository](https://github.com/owid/monkeypox/blob/main/owid-monkeypox-data.csv) hosted on GitHub. While this data was originally published by the World Health Organization (WHO), as of late 2023, WHO no longer makes this data publicly available for download. As a result, OWID's archived download of the data is used.

* **Wikipedia**: Daily pageviews for mpox-related Wikipedia articles are queried directly from Wikimedia.
