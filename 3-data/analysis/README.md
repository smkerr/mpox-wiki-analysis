# Data Sources

* **World Health Organization (WHO)**: Mpox cases aggregated by country and onset onset (or diagnosis date or report date if missing) were downloaded from WHO's [2022-23 Mpox (Monkeypox) Outbreak: Global Trends](https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/) site. 
* **Our World in Data (OWID)**: Mpox cases and deaths aggregated by country and report date were downloaded from OWID's [`monkeypox` repository](https://github.com/owid/monkeypox/blob/main/owid-monkeypox-data.csv) on GitHub. While this data was originally published by WHO, as of November 2023, WHO no longer makes this data publicly available for download. As a result, OWID's archived download of the data is used.
