# to evaluate whether translating models from one location to another is feasible, we compute a metric rt for each pair of locations tested on the same disease. This meta-correlation is simply the Pearson's r computed between the correlation scores r of each article found in both languages; the intent is to give a gross notion of similarity between models computed for the same disease in two different languages. A value of 1 means that the two models are identical, 0 means they have no relationship, and -1 means they are opposite.
